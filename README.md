# Basic OpenGL rendered game engine (Game Engine Version 1)

This would be a basic game engine with most parts being made by following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpBGwZNyUh0&list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M-. Other parts such as the 
physics system would be made by me. It does need some fixing (in terms of 2d UI rendering on a 3D space).

Nothing that big would have been added in this engine. Just a basic rendering system with functions to read vertices and indices.
